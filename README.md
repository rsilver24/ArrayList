Hello! Welcome to the README! This compilation of files is meant to make a custom ArrayList method.

ArrayList.java holds the constructors, instance data, and methods of the ArrrayList object.

ArrayListTester.java contains a file used in order to test if ArrayList.java is working as intended.

Node.java is a necessary component to making the ArrayList.java work as intended, storing data, parents, and children.

Each element in the ArrayList is a node itself. This Node contains a value (of any type), a parent Node (leading to the previous listed value), and a child node (leading to the next listed value).
